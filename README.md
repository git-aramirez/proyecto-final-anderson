This project consists of simulating different algorithms found in the computational infrastructure, in order to guide students of courses related to computational infrastructure in the teaching and learning process.

Modules such as:

1) Process planning.
2) Tuning strategies.
3) Process Synchronization
4) Process Communication
5) Memory Segmentation
6) Memory Paging
7) Disk Allocation
8) Disk Partitioning
